[Intro]
I see nothing out the window, window
Nothing out the window
Watching all the leaves grow, leaves grow
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though

[Verse]
And the sun will shine, no more
The sun will shine (antidote), no more
I've been holding on, too long
Holding on too

[Pre-Chorus]
I know when the wind blows, wind blows
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though
I just wanna sleep forever
Please just let me leave, forever

[Chorus]
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, forever
(Forever, forever)

[Bridge]
We don't wanna drive slow, drive slow
Speed up with our eyes closed, eyes closed

[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
Head down, eyes closed
Ice cold, meltdown
